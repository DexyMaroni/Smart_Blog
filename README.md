## Introduction

## Project Overview:
Bluey Blog is an application where users can create and edit profiles, as well as create posts on their favorite topics with the ability to update and delete them. Its interface is designed to be simple and user-friendly, and users can trust that their data is encrypted for security.

### Additional features include:
- Quick and easy password recovery
- Post categorization from other users

## Context:
As I conclude the foundation stage at African Leadership Academy, I embarked on building a portfolio project of my choosing. The three weeks spent on this project have been both enjoyable and educational.

 **Divine's Post** (https://www.linkedin.com/posts/divine-inyang-5165b0247_ever-dreamed-of-building-your-very-own-application-activity-7166860783228805120-X8Hh?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

## Installation:
As the application is not yet deployed, it is recommended to have a Python IDE installed, preferably Visual Studio Code, along with Python itself. To get started:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file
3. You are now ready to post on the application.

## Technology:
The application is built entirely with the Python framework Flask, along with its extensions. Key extensions such as Bcrypt, its-dangerous, and Werkzeug play vital roles in ensuring the security of the application. The database is constructed using the Flask SQLAlchemy extension.

## Frontend Technology:
To achieve a visually appealing and user-friendly interface, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML, and JavaScript were employed.
